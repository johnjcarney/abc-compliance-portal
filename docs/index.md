As an educational institution, we hold the most valuable data in the world: the identities and futures of our students. 

In compliance with **Vietnam Decree No. 13/2023/ND-CP**, this portal establishes the technical and organizational measures we take to protect that data. Compliance is not just a legal checkbox; it is a promise of safety to our community.

### Key Principles
1.  **Transparency:** We do not hide how we use data.
2.  **Minimization:** We collect only what we need.
3.  **Security:** We protect data as if it were our own.
